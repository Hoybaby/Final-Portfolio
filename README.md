#Finial Portfolio for Michael Bartek

## Description
This is the portfolio for myself, Michael Bartek. With the use of mainly HTML and CSS, I created a website to display my skills and projects for employers to look at. The project is mobile responsive and does send an email to my mailbox when contact form is submitted. With some help of Vladimir Dimitrov, I tweaked some aspects to make it more presentable to the masses.
